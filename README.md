# List drag-and-drop tutorial demo

This project is the demo and source code for the [list drag-and-drop tutorial](https://www.akasharojee.codes/2021/07/18/list-drag-and-drop-tutorial.html) on my blog.

This tutorial explains the basic concepts of the HTML Drag and Drop API and shows how to implement it in a list, including a simple row-shifting mechanism.

The functionalities can definitely be extended, and improved. 

More code has to be written for the following scenarios:

- Drag over at least another row, then drop outside of the list
- Drag over at least another row, then drag outside of the list, then drop at a non-adjacent row
- Drag outside of the list immediately, then drop inside the list, but over a child element
